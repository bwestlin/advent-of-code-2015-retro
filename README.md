# Advent of Code 2015 done retrospectively

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015/) written in some different languages.

This was a fun activity we decided to do at work where we met up every week to discuss the solutions, while the solutions themselves were done during spare time. As we also were comparing the solutions in terms of execution speed my solutions is oriented towards that.

My initial idea was to use different languages every now and then which I did in the beginning such as [Kona/K](https://kona.github.io/#/), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [Go](https://golang.org/), but I quickly ended up doing most of them only in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

For more info on the rust solutions see: [rust](rust)

#### To run solution for a given day for in a given language: (day 01 and rust below)

```
./run.sh rust 01
```
